					<h2>Analysis</h2>
					<br>
					<p>
						This graph shows the realationship between Median Household Income for the year and the percent of individuals that engaged in Physical Activity
						in the past month. There seems to be a decent correlation (~.63) between Median Household Income and Physical Activity levels.
						From the graph, we can gather that areas that have a fairly high Median Income tend to have a high physical activity level.
						Conversely, states in the Deep South (MS, AR, AL, LA) appear to have among the lowest incomes and the lowest activity levels.
						Things that may have a hidden impact on this analysis could be when the individuals were polled about activity levels - winter months
						would tend to have a lower activity level (sans areas that may be geared more towards winter sports) while summer would tend to have a higher activity
						level. Additionally, the generalization of what constitutes "Physical Activity" could lead to an error in sampling among those polled.
